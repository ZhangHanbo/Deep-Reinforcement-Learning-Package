# Deep Reinforcement Learning PyTorch

## Introduction

This is a deep reinforcement learning package provided by Hanbo Zhang 
from Xi'an Jiaotong University. This package will be updated continuously
to contain main-stream RL algorithms, such as **DQN, DDPG, TRPO, PPO, GAIL, 
etc.**

## Implemented Algorithms

Value-based RL algorithms: DQN, Double DQN, Dueling DQN, NAF

Policy-based RL algorithms: PG, DDPG, NPG, TRPO, PPO

## Baselines

## TODO list

To implement:

ACER, Q-prop, HER, GAIL, TD3, A3C

To complete existing codes:

Add command line arguments.

Atari and Roboschool baseline. (I have no Mojoco License, therefore no mojoco games will be included.)

More modularized codes.
